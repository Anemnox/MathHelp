      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Often, we are taught mathematics procedurally. Procedural learning is the idea of learning
        the steps to solving a problem. Procedural learning is valuable when we need to learn how
        to solve a category of problems that have been solved. Once we are familiar with the formula,
        we are able to practice and learn to solve categories of problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the patterns that I've seen with students on tests such as the SAT is that when they
        come across a problem that they have not explicitly learned how to solve, they are unable to
        find the patterns behind the concepts to come up with a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal for this series of lessons is to visualize the conceptual understanding of Algebra 
        so students are able to understand a bit of the reasoning behind the concepts that they've
        learned. There is a bit of an assumption that they are familiar with Algebra but even if
        they don't the content is aimed to be accessible to beginners.

      <h1>What is a Function?</h1>
      <p>
        We can imagine a function as being a set of operations that have an input and
        result in an output. Lets imagine the function \(f(x) = x + 3\). We can see that the
        function will take in a number and result in 3 more than the input number.  If \(x = 3\),
        then \(f(x) = 6\). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a moment to imagine all of the different numbers that we can think of. We can put whole numbers,
        fractions, and decimals into this function to get an output that is 3 more than the given number.
        This is the idea of <b>Domain</b> and <b>Range</b>. The domain is a set of all of the possible numbers we can
        put into the function and the range is a set of all of the possible numbers we can get out of the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each number in the domain, there will be a corresponding number in the range. We will be specifically
        working with lines in this lesson so we will have an infinite amount of numbers in the domain and either
        one number or an infinite amount of numbers in the range.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look at some of the input and outputs for the function \(f(x) = x + 3\).

    <div id="lines">
      <h1>Lines</h1>
      <p>
        Lines are one of the simplest ways to imagine the properties of functions. We are able to graph functions
        using the cartesian coordinate system.
